## Explorations
- [ ] We want to always remember going through distance learning as an entire community. In order to that, I would like for you to draw a picture of the "tool" or "tools" that you are using for distance learning. That could be a chrome book, tablet, paper, pencil, or crayons.
After you have drawn your picture of what you mostly use, please label (name) the parts. If you have time, write a sentence or two about distance learning.... we don't ever want to forget!
